# FloodForge

FloodForge is a C++ remake of a few Rain World modding tools.

It aims for intuitive controls, clean ui, and as few dependencies as possible.

## Building
### Windows
Requirements:
- [MSYS2 MINGW](https://www.msys2.org)

#### One time build
If you want to have a permanent executable that you can run whenever, use this option.
`./Build.bat`

#### Building for debugging
Use this if you are editing the code and need to quickly test
`./Build.bat --debug`

#### Shell script
The build.sh script also works under Msys2.

First, install Make:
```bash
pacman -S make
```

Then run one of these three commands:
```bash
./Build.sh
./Build.sh --debug
./Build.sh --release
```

### Linux
> [!WARNING]  
> Linux builds are untested, they may not work.

Requirements:
- GLFW3
- pkg-config
- Make

```bash
chmod +x Build.sh # make file executable
./Build.sh

# build in debug mode
./Build.sh --debug

# build in release mode
./Build.sh --release
```

## Custom Themes
To create a custom theme, you need to modify the file `assets/theme.txt`.
FloodForge will only load `theme.txt`, so if you need a backup, feel free to duplicate it.
